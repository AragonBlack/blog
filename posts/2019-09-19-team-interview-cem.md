**Hello Cem, please tell us a bit about yourself, your background and what is it that you do at Aragon Black?**

Hello anonymous interviewer ;) I’m Cem, strategy lead at AB. I’m a longtime sailor who is cursed to live in-land for the last 11 years or so. I have deep interests in social transformation, self-governance and innovative value systems. At Aragon Black, i try to bring those interests to actualization by help design and put to use early versions of what could become prominent ways of organizing in the future. I am responsible for our team’s strategic coherence, communications, competence as well as the on boarding of capable projects onto the Aragon apps which we are creating.

**Do you think that the position and missions of a project manager are changing right now in the way teams organize themselves in blockchain ecosystem?**

100%

Blockchain is pushing FOSS paradigm into new (cyber)territory. The interiors of a legacy organization is taking place out in the open now. Which implies that many of the existing processes must be adapted to this new paradigm. In the case of project management, the nature of both “project” and “management” has significantly shifted.  Projects usually comprise of multiple teams and contributors. Teams are made up of autonomous agents. These challenges call for new methodologies where communication becomes the fundamental scarce resource which has to be managed attentively.

**What are the tools (analytical, methodical, graphical) you favor the most in your work of Strategy Lead, and why?**

As part of my work, i find it crucial to answer particular questions:

1.  Who are the participants in the ecosystem and how is the landscape changing?

The interface for this is one’s life, a.k.a being drowned in blockchain and social reformation. CT also helps to keep up to date (& cynical of big EGOs)

2.  What is being built?

On top of my own research, Olivier and Daniel are my favorite tools to get opinions and engage in thought experiments with regards to relevant uses leveraging the ecosystems composability.

3.  Where do the synergic use-cases lie in autonomous systems?

This is my favorite one, as my dream is to mutate the current archetype of the entrepreneur into its web3 context. An entrepreneur which is not conditioned for hyper-growth or deriving all motivation from dreams of an exit. An entrepreneur who understands how to build equitable networks, who can think beyond profit maximization without tinkering with pseudo economics. An entrepreneur who utilizes principles of conservation and adaptation who can conceive and deploy the organizational structures of the sci-fi future.

**What are your thoughts on the Aragon community? And what are the futur steps you imagine for helping spreading this community even more?**

Shill time! Brace yourselves..

My first “holy shit” moment was during Aracon, where i realized the extent of what this community has been producing in coordination. Next, I never thought a Forum could be so interesting until I met[ Aragon Forum](https://forum.aragon.org/). Even though going through our AGP was an arduous process , I’ve seen how its community makes Aragon bullshit proof. It’s just unprecedented to see that degree of oversight, strategic evaluation, creative propositions and compassion.

Going forward there are some steps, which i believe can significantly increase the potential and the reach of the Aragon community.

First one is to create interfaces between the roles in the Aragon community.  In the scenario where Flock teams have a say in the distribution of Nest grants, where all the teams are incentivized to have apprenticeship programs with individual contributors looking to take part in the community, we can achieve a much more aligned and fluid state.

Second one is to build an Aragon Academy or something to that effect, where the interested individuals are provided with continuous facilitation into how to use, design and build with Aragon.

This way we can reduce frictions arising from knowledge barriers in a less time-constrained way, while allowing a clear pathway for contributors to plug in to our community as functioning agents.

**Do you remember the first time you heard about blockchain and what were your thoughts about it?**

I was informed about Bitcoins existence in 2012 from my college flatmate. I did not understand the intricacies of the network initially, however made the assessment that this instrument can be easily manipulated by external agents, namely the establishment(So much ROI for that correct assessment). But my real fascination was seeded around 2014-15, reading about Ethereum and watching Vitalik Buterin talk about how it differentiates from Bitcoin. I was always more fascinated by progressive propositions, simply because I think the end is near and we must act fast, both because of reflexivity and just pure entertainment.

**Fork is a big issue in the Pando Network vision, let’s imagine we could roll back time for an instant, at the moment when “The DAO” crashed, were you a pro-fork person or a non-fork person?**

I could say that I favor pragmatism more than ideology at earlier stages of development. The gradient should shift towards values as the technology becomes more robust. In terms of blockchains its clearly a dilemma since the protocol itself is the encoded ideology, made explicit for interested parties to opt-in to. I will try and refrain from choosing a side here overall.

**Collaboration is a very big issue in your project, so let’s talk a bit more about your team. How did you guys meet?**

A series of divine interventions brought me and Dani together with these 3, relatively weird French philosophers. Following some calls about Wespr, Horatii Partners and our avenues of collaboration, we decided to meet face to face. Due to reasons I won’t go in to now, the meeting took place in the middle of a forest where we mind-melded about socio-political transformation, state of blockchain and our ideas towards actualization. It was a beautiful beginning and we still have the same excitement and alignment today.

**In your opinion, what is it that keeps your team motivated towards the same vision?**

The people who are trying to build an alternative where there seems to be none. Being near each other, caring about the same cause and the same potentialities enables us to move away from being solitary cynical intellects towards collective self-actualization. For this I am very grateful to this team.

**What is your personal and human contribution to your team?**

These self related questions are always tricky but i guess i cant leave it blank.

Wether its about our strategy or just our personal communications as a team, I try to see the whole picture. Thanks to this I can focus on what matters contextually and I find that such perspective is usually appreciated.

**Conversely, what is the weird/annoying thing that you do, and that your team could or has noticed about you?**

I can be very impatient and a bit too honest & direct. But I feel that we are mostly aligned on our flaws as well :)

**Let’s talk a bit more about you. Beside Pando and Aragon Black, what are your hobbies/interests?**

I'm a thalassophile. Have been sailing since age 9. Intrigued about the graph of arts, philosophy and social transformation.

**If you had to choose an author that could be your leitmotiv author, which one would it be and why?**

Borges without a doubt.

He was effectively a slap on my non-fiction obsessed face and has shown me the power/art of world-building. I recommend reading Tlon, Uqbar and Orbis Tertius for a masterclass into unanchored but internally cohesive worldcraft.

**Can you give us a quote that has inspired you in many ways so far!?**

"... *the rest has to be said in silence"*

Rumi

**Let’s end with this, if you had to create “The” playlist of your journey within the blockchain ecosystem, what would you choose for your opening song?**

*War Ina Babylon* or *Chase the Devil* by Max Romeo
