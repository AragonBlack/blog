This September, we met Paul Kohlhaas to speak about decentralization of the pharmaceutical industry...

**What is Molecule ?**

We're building a platform and marketplace for development and trading of pharmaceutical IP. Our goal is to distribute the costs, risks and ownership on how drug development works today. Essentially make drug development more like open source software. So creating incentives for people to release information out into the public and for the development of new therapeutics in a way that is more democratic and collaboration driven. This would unite different stakeholders, individuals, researchers around how a drug can be brought to market.

**Which problems are you tackling ?**

Ultimately bringing down the cost and the long time to market that you have in pharma today. A lot of those high costs and long time to markets can be drawn back to how monopolized pharma is today. So today it's really like one company does all the work and then creates a monopoly on that work. But a lot of therapeutics fail because of that. So having an approach where actually the market drives the compounds is much more efficient.

**Why curation market for the pharmaceutical industry ?**

We do have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of potential therapeutics and molecules that could be used to treat a potential disease or a potential group of diseases. You have a lot of different compounds and today each company does all of the work themselves to identify the right ones, to patent them and then bring them to market. What propose is that instead of having each company do their own pipeline, we just create a market and then the market curates the best treatments to be advanced and go to market.

There's a lot of potential treatments. But all the companies are doing their own work at the moment. So if you put them on a platform and have market participants that curate the most valuable IP the market could be much more efficient.

**What is the interest of molecule for scientific research ?**

Ideally it's much simpler access to capital than you have today. Researchers can commercialize the IP or their inventions without having to create companies around them. So it's an alternative financing model for researchers, it's a much more democratic entrance grant financing model than the current like VC funding or grant funding, which both of them take very long. On the other side, it's also just a different collaboration and development model. So instead of doing all the work myself, I can collaborate with other researchers. I can easily give other researchers shares in the IP that I'm developing, and through that, through the exit, bring down my costs and accelerate time to market.

**Which diseases will you target first and why ?**

So the current disease areas that we are working on are rare and neglected diseases.

Specifically in malaria where there's strong open source research communities around those drugs, in biogen gerontology and longevity research, where they developing molecules to like slow down aging of human body. The last one is in psychedelic research.

**Do you plan to use Aragon Fundraising ?**

Yes, but probably not in the alpha. I think there's two value propositions with [Aragon fundraising](https://blog.aragon.org/introducing-a...). One is fundraising for DAOs. But for what we're doing at the moment we only need fundraising. So a DAO would over-complicate the user experience for the researchers because the researchers are like : I'm doing this scientific project. I need to raise $100,000 to  do the project. I will open source all the results and maybe you guys get to share the results, but there's no need of governance structure from the contributors side.

For scientific researchers It's like very clear, I have this project and I am spending the money on this equipment. So in the alpha a DAO over complicates things. But we are very keen to experiment that much more. So for example, one of the malaria projects that we're working with, there is an opportunity to fund the open source IP. So you put it into the commons and then you need to decide how do we continue develop this, how do we fundraise it. And then it's a kind of a more open source consortium of different people working together. So for those use cases we’re much more looking at using it. And then probably running like an early experiment or like an early trial with one of those groups to see whether the system works well. I mean we're very excited about the modularity of Aragon Fundraising but we don't need a lot of the features or user interfaces that come with Aragon as a whole. We can't give this to like someone who is in pharma and drug development because they only care about very specific things. They don't care about having all of these other features. If I'm presenting them the whole thing i will confuse them. But on the other side, I mean all of those features are amazing and they're very useful depending on what you're trying to do. But that's something that we kind of went through just more thinking from user interface and like showing this to people that are not in crypto and maybe that don't even care about decentralization that much. They just want something that works.

**Who works with you ?**

We're working with a lot of universities we've signed letters of intent already with civil partnership agreement. We’re also working with research labs and smaller biotech companies.  We're also start working with larger pharma companies that are trying to understand which part they can play in an ecosystem like this. We're also working with a lot of companies that are using AI for drug discovery. So they use AI to discover new compounds and then they can put them on our system. Then obviously also with institutional investors that would be looking to invest into the compounds. We're trying to work with regulators as well.

**How to make intellectual property liquid ?**

It's like a Delaware LLC. And then you move the IP into that special purpose vehicle and then the ownership of the special purpose vehicle almost gets like ledgered into a NFT and then the company doesn't own anything else than this IP.
